QAoffice creation memo

1. Prepare the global (our project's) repository.
    I signed in to github web site.  Then move to,
        https://github.com/orgs/webdbhosei/dashboard
    Here, I click [NEW] button right side at 'repositories',

    Now I see "Create a new repository" page.
    I input 'QAoffice' as the repository name,
    clicked the 'public' button instead of 'private,'
    and then, clicked the "Create repository" button.

    Here, be CAREFUL. NEVER check to "initialize this repository
    with a README."  If you create README file, you cannot "push"
    your local repository to this global repository.

    Now I am in the "webdbhosei/QAoffice" top page.
    I go to the pull-down of "clone or download."
    From "Clone with HTTPS" pop up, copy the project git URL from the
    input box.  The file path is as the following;
        https://github.com/webdbhosei/QAoffice.git

    This path will be used to setup local git configuration.

2. Create project
    $ django-admin startproject QAoffice

3. prepare virtual environment
    Change your current directory to QAoffice, the project root.
    $ cd QAoffice
    Then, create virtual environment.
    $ python -m venv qao_env

   now get into the virtual environment.
    $ source qao_env/bin/activate

   The environment is empty, so prepare some necessary modules.
    $ pip install --upgrade pip

4. prepare 'requirements.txt'
    Create 'requirements.txt' in the root(QAoffice) directory.

    This file describes the necessary modules, so that other people can
    install the modules without typing each module installation command.
    Other people can install the necessary modules by only typing:
        "pip install -r requirements.txt"

    First added only the following:
        pip==20.1.1
        wheel
        django
    And then, typed the command:
        $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    Now, wheel and django had been installed, so check the version of
    those modules, by typing the command:
        $ pip list
    and then, modified to specify the versions of modules.
        wheel==0.34.2
        django==3.0.7

5. Now prepare the local git repository.
    Type the command:
        $ git init

    Now, we want to avoid huge virtual environment libraries are included
    in the repository, to waste memory.  Prepare .gitignore file.
    Create '.gitignore' file in the root(QAoffice) directory.

    Then, write only one line, in the file;
        qao_env/
    Now, these virtual environment directory will be excluded from the git
    management.

    Add rest of all the files to the git control.
    Type the following command in the root directory.
        $ git add .

    Check if the local information is registered in the local git config.
        $ git config --global --list
    I have got the following response.
        user.email=ikuo.kobayashi.XXXXX@hosei.ac.jp
        user.name=Kobayashi Ikuo
    OK.  I had registered myself.  If those two elements had not been replied,
    type the following command respectively;
        $ git config —global user.name YOUR_NAME_HERE
        $ git config —global user.email YOUR_EMAIL_HERE

    Now, the project is empty, but prepare the first commitment;
        $ git commit -m 'first commitment'

    Here, I added "this file" as setup_note.txt

6. Register remote repository information to the local repository.
    $ git remote add origin https://github.com/webdbhosei/QAoffice.git

    Now, upload (push) local project to the github.

    $ git push origin master

    ---> Setup Done!
